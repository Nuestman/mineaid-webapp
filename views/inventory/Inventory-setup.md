### **Explanation of Columns**
1. **id**: A unique identifier to differentiate entries, helpful for tracking and troubleshooting.
2. **date**: This ensures daily entries are timestamped for historical tracking and reporting.
3. **item_name**: Clearly identifies the item being logged, essential for clarity and filtering.
4. **category**: Enables grouping of items into their respective categories (medications, consumables, equipment).
5. **opening_stock**: Captures the quantity at the start of the day for stock tracking.
6. **used**: Tracks the daily consumption of the item, calculated based on staff usage logs or estimates.
7. **added**: Records restocking amounts, helping to monitor inventory inflows.
8. **closing_stock**: Calculates the day's ending stock automatically using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Closing Stock} = \text{Opening Stock} - \text{Used} + \text{Added}
   \]
9. **status**: Provides a visual or textual indicator of whether stock levels are acceptable.
10. **expiry_date**: For perishable items, indicates when the item will expire.
11. **next_service_date**: Tracks when equipment needs servicing.
12. **checked_by**: Adds accountability, indicating who performed the checklist review.

### **Weekly and Monthly Summaries**
To summarize stock levels:
- **Week-End Stock Levels**:
  Use the **closing_stock** column from the last entry of each week to get weekly stock snapshots.
- **Monthly Totals**:
  Aggregate the **used**, **added**, and **closing_stock** columns to understand monthly usage and restocking needs.
