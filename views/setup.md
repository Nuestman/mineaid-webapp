1. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

    Create a form to collect user input.
    Use JavaScript to validate the form and interact with the backend.

2. Backend (Node.js/Express or Django/Flask)

    Store daily form submissions in a database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, or MySQL).
    Ensure that the data can be retrieved and displayed for statistics.

3. Database

    Design a table structure that can store daily inputs.
    Create queries to summarize the data for the end-of-month statistics.

4. Statistics/Reporting

    Calculate totals, averages, or other relevant statistics.
    Display them in a dashboard or export them as reports (PDF/Excel).

Do you already have a stack in mind, or would you like recommendations for the best tools to use?


Since you prefer something not too complicated, I'll suggest a simple stack that balances ease of use, flexibility, and functionality:

### **Stack Recommendation**

#### 1. **Frontend**
   - **HTML** + **CSS** + **JavaScript**: These are essential for creating a form and handling user interactions.
   - **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework to help you quickly style your form and make it responsive.

#### 2. **Backend**
   - **Node.js** with **Express**: 
     - Node.js is JavaScript-based, so you don’t have to learn a new language.
     - Express is a lightweight framework for building the backend, handling form submissions, and managing routes.
   
#### 3. **Database**
   - **SQLite**: It’s a serverless, lightweight database. Perfect for small-scale applications, and easy to set up with Node.js.

#### 4. **Deployment**
   - **Heroku**: An easy-to-use platform for deploying your app.
   - **GitHub**: Use this for version control and to store your project code.

### **High-level Setup**

1. **Frontend Form**:
   - Design a form to collect daily data (e.g., name, email, or any other specific data).
   - Use Bootstrap for styling and make the form mobile-friendly.

2. **Backend with Express**:
   - Create routes for submitting the form data.
   - Set up an endpoint to save the data to the SQLite database.
   - Another route can be set up to query and calculate monthly statistics.

3. **Database**:
   - SQLite database to store the daily form inputs.
   - Tables could include columns for date, user input fields, and any other information you want to capture.

4. **Statistics/Reporting**:
   - At the end of the month, fetch the data from the database.
   - Use JavaScript/Node.js to calculate relevant statistics and display them on a dashboard.

#### **Example Flow**:
- User submits the form daily.
- Data gets stored in the SQLite database.
- At the end of the month, you run a query to calculate stats like averages, totals, etc.
- Display results on a simple dashboard.

Would you like me to provide more details on how to set up any of these steps, like the code for the form or the backend setup?


Let's start from the ground up and build **First Aid Portal** step by step. Here’s a roadmap to help you start the project:

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Project Structure**
1. **Install Node.js** (Backend framework) if you don’t have it installed.
   - Go to [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version.
   - Once installed, check if it’s working by running `node -v` in your terminal.

2. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:
   - Open your terminal and create a project folder.
     ```bash
     mkdir first-aid-portal
     cd first-aid-portal
     ```
   - Initialize a Node.js project in the folder:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```
   - This will create a `package.json` file, which manages dependencies for the project.

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - Install **Express** (web framework) and **SQLite3** (database).
     ```bash
     npm install express sqlite3
     ```
   - Optional (but recommended): Install **nodemon** to automatically restart the server when files change.
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev nodemon
     ```

### **Step 2: Basic File Structure**

In your project folder, you should organize it like this:

```
first-aid-portal/
│
├── public/           # Static assets (CSS, images)
├── views/            # HTML files
├── database/         # SQLite database files
├── routes/           # API or page routes
├── app.js            # Main Express app
└── package.json      # NPM dependencies file
```

### **Step 3: Set Up Your Express Server**

1. **Create `app.js`**:
   This will be the entry point for the backend.

   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const path = require('path');
   const app = express();

   // Middleware to handle form data
   app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
   app.use(express.json());

   // Static folder for CSS and images
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

   // Set views folder for HTML
   app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
   app.set('view engine', 'ejs'); // You can use HTML directly or EJS for templates.

   // Homepage route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.render('index'); // Renders the form
   });

   // Sample route for handling form data
   app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
     console.log(req.body);
     res.send('Form submitted successfully');
   });

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT}`));
   ```

2. **Create the Form (HTML) in `views/index.ejs`**:
   This will be the form that captures the daily data. You can use EJS for templating, or simple HTML.


### **Step 4: Create the Database (SQLite)**

1. **Set Up SQLite Database**:
   - Create a folder named `database` and within it a file `db.js` for database operations.
   
   ```js
   const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
   const db = new sqlite3.Database('./database/first_aid.db');

   db.serialize(() => {
     // Create a table for storing daily records
     db.run(`
       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS daily_records (
         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
         date TEXT,
         post TEXT,
         cases INTEGER,
         description TEXT
       )
     `);
   });

   module.exports = db;
   ```

2. **Connect and Store Data**:
   - Modify your `app.js` to insert form data into the SQLite database.

   ```js
   const db = require('./database/db');

   app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
     const { date, post, cases, description } = req.body;
     
     db.run(`
       INSERT INTO daily_records (date, post, cases, description)
       VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
     `, [date, post, cases, description], function(err) {
       if (err) {
         console.error(err.message);
         res.status(500).send('Database error');
       } else {
         res.send('Form submitted and saved successfully!');
       }
     });
   });
   ```

### **Step 5: Run the Application**

- Start the server:
   ```bash
   nodemon app.js
   ```
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the form.
- Submitting the form will now save the data into your SQLite database.

### **Next Steps**:

1. **Building the Statistics Page**: You can later query this data to build a statistics page showing summaries for the month.
2. **Add Styling**: Use CSS/Bootstrap to enhance the user interface and make it visually appealing.
3. **User Authentication (optional)**: You can add login functionality to restrict access if needed.

<!-- Moving to a new directory/PC -->
Yes, you can move your Node.js project, including your **First Aid Portal** app, to a different directory or even to a different PC. However, there are a few steps to follow to ensure everything works smoothly after the move.

### Moving the Project to a Different Directory or PC

1. **Move the Project Files**:
   - You can copy the entire project folder (e.g., `first-aid-portal/`) to a new location or a different PC.

2. **Reinstall Dependencies**:
   - When you move the project, the `node_modules` folder (which contains all the installed packages) is usually not moved because it can be large. 
   - Once you've moved the project, run the following command in the terminal inside the project directory to reinstall all dependencies from the `package.json` file:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This will recreate the `node_modules` folder with all the required dependencies.

3. **Database Considerations (SQLite)**:
   - SQLite stores data in a file (e.g., `first_aid.db`). If you are moving your project, **ensure the SQLite database file is moved too**. If your database file is located in the `database/` folder, it will move with the project.

   If you're moving the project to a different PC:
   - Ensure that Node.js is installed on the new machine.
   - Copy the entire project directory, including the SQLite database file.

4. **Starting the Project Again**:
   - Once you've moved the project and reinstalled dependencies, you can start the server as usual:
     ```bash
     nodemon app.js  # or node app.js if nodemon isn't installed
     ```

### Summary of Steps for a New PC:

1. Copy the project folder to the new machine.
2. Ensure **Node.js** is installed on the new machine.
3. Run `npm install` to reinstall all dependencies.
4. Start the server with `nodemon app.js` or `node app.js`.

That's it! The project should work exactly the same after being moved.


Step 1: Install ejs

In your project directory, run the following command to install ejs:

bash

npm install ejs

Step 2: Restart the Server

After installing ejs, restart your server using nodemon:

bash

npx nodemon app.js

Then try accessing http://localhost:3000/ again. You should no longer see the error.
