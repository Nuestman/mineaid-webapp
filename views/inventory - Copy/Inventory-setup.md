lets revisit the inventory from the beginning. it seems we building without finishing the planning which is causing complexities and losing focus. 
we have a medical app-ish to manage the first aid posts.
FAPs have equipment, medications and consumables to run the daily business of caring for the sick ad injured. and this requires keeping some sort of inventory.
we have 4 FAP and a central EMS which stores all supplies and distributes to faps on request for replenishment.
our current setup on the ground for keeping track of items is using a paper system at each post which has a list/register of all emergency medications, consumables and equipment. this sheet has columns nameofitem, initial quantity, expiry date, a column for each day of the month (1,....31)
The last day of the month sets up the closing stock, which is copied to the new sheet (next month) as initial stock.
this system requires that each single item is counted manually everyday and the quantity written under each day column.

i read somewhere that, for the db creation, we'll need some sort of organizational mgt, product, inventory, sales, accounting&finance to pull this off. but in our case, we wont be adding any sales or accounting.

the purpose of the inventory part of the mineaid webapp is to remove this tedious counting and digitalise it and if possible automate as much as possible.
how can we achieve this? lets plan now without any code. what structures do we need in place?

An **inventory register** that integrates **daily checklist entries** should capture essential details to track stock levels and summarize data effectively. Hereâ€™s how it could be structured, along with an explanation of each column:

---

### **Inventory Register Table Structure**
| Column Name              | Data Type    | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **id**                   | Integer      | Unique identifier for each entry.                                           |
| **date**                 | Date         | The date the checklist entry was recorded.                                  |
| **item_name**            | String       | Name of the item (medication, consumable, or equipment).                    |
| **category**             | String       | Category of the item (`medication`, `consumable`, `equipment`).             |
| **opening_stock**        | Integer      | Quantity of the item at the start of the day.                               |
| **used**                 | Integer      | Quantity of the item used during the day.                                   |
| **added**                | Integer      | Quantity of the item restocked or added during the day.                     |
| **closing_stock**        | Integer      | Quantity of the item at the end of the day (`opening_stock - used + added`).|
| **status**               | String       | Indicates stock status (`Sufficient`, `Low`, `Out of Stock`, etc.).         |
| **expiry_date**          | Date         | Expiry date for medications and consumables (if applicable).                |
| **next_service_date**    | Date         | Next service date for equipment (if applicable).                            |
| **checked_by**           | String       | The name or ID of the staff member who performed the daily checklist.       |

---

### **Explanation of Columns**
1. **id**: A unique identifier to differentiate entries, helpful for tracking and troubleshooting.
2. **date**: This ensures daily entries are timestamped for historical tracking and reporting.
3. **item_name**: Clearly identifies the item being logged, essential for clarity and filtering.
4. **category**: Enables grouping of items into their respective categories (medications, consumables, equipment).
5. **opening_stock**: Captures the quantity at the start of the day for stock tracking.
6. **used**: Tracks the daily consumption of the item, calculated based on staff usage logs or estimates.
7. **added**: Records restocking amounts, helping to monitor inventory inflows.
8. **closing_stock**: Calculates the day's ending stock automatically using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Closing Stock} = \text{Opening Stock} - \text{Used} + \text{Added}
   \]
9. **status**: Provides a visual or textual indicator of whether stock levels are acceptable.
10. **expiry_date**: For perishable items, indicates when the item will expire.
11. **next_service_date**: Tracks when equipment needs servicing.
12. **checked_by**: Adds accountability, indicating who performed the checklist review.

### **Weekly and Monthly Summaries**
To summarize stock levels:
- **Week-End Stock Levels**:
  Use the **closing_stock** column from the last entry of each week to get weekly stock snapshots.
- **Monthly Totals**:
  Aggregate the **used**, **added**, and **closing_stock** columns to understand monthly usage and restocking needs.

### **Sample Data**
| id  | date       | item_name        | category    | opening_stock | used | added | closing_stock | status      | expiry_date | next_service_date | checked_by   |
|-----|------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1   | 2024-11-16 | Paracetamol 500mg| Medication  | 200           | 20   | 0     | 180           | Sufficient  | 2025-01-30  | NULL              | Jane Doe     |
| 2   | 2024-11-16 | Syringes (5ml)   | Consumable  | 100           | 15   | 50    | 135           | Sufficient  | NULL        | NULL              | John Smith   |
| 3   | 2024-11-16 | Defibrillator    | Equipment   | 1             | 0    | 0     | 1             | Functional  | NULL        | 2025-06-10        | Jane Doe     |

### **Key Features for Reporting**
1. **Daily Report**:
   - Stock levels per item at the start and end of the day.
   - Items flagged as low, expired, or requiring service.
   - Checklist completion record.

2. **Weekly Report**:

   - Total stock added (restocking) during the week.
   - Closing stock levels at the end of the week.

3. **Monthly Report**:
   - Total quantities used and restocked during the month.
   - Summary of items nearing expiry or service requirements.
   - Aggregated closing stock for trend analysis.

### **Integration**
1. **Populate Register**:
   - Capture data from the daily checklist form and update the register table with calculated values.
2. **Generate Reports**:
   - Use SQL queries to group and aggregate data for weekly and monthly summaries.
3. **Alert System**:
   - Automatically flag items with low stock, nearing expiry, or requiring service.
