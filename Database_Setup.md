Let's set up a temporary endpoint in your Render app to download the SQLite database file before each deployment. This approach will allow you to back up the live database data from Render to avoid data loss between deployments.

### Setting Up the Download Endpoint

Here's a step-by-step guide to create a secure, temporary endpoint to download the SQLite database file:

1. **Create the Download Route in Your App**

   Open your main server file (e.g., `mineaid-app.js`) and add the following code to create an endpoint that allows you to download the SQLite database file securely.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const path = require('path');
   const app = express();

   // Temporary download endpoint for SQLite backup
   app.get('/download-sqlite-backup', (req, res) => {
     const dbPath = path.join(__dirname, 'database', 'mineaid.db'); // Update the path if needed
     
     // Set up a basic check to restrict access (change as needed)
     if (req.query.secret !== process.env.DOWNLOAD_SECRET) {
       return res.status(403).send('Unauthorized');
     }
     
     // Send the SQLite file as a download
     res.download(dbPath, 'mineaid-backup.db', (err) => {
       if (err) {
         console.error('Error downloading database:', err);
         res.status(500).send('Error downloading the file');
       }
     });
   });
   ```

   - **Important**: Set up a secret code for secure access by adding `DOWNLOAD_SECRET` to your environment variables on Render (e.g., in the Render dashboard):
     - Example: `DOWNLOAD_SECRET=myStrongSecret123`
   - When accessing the endpoint, you’ll need to include this `secret` query parameter for security, e.g., `https://your-app-url.com/download-sqlite-backup?secret=myStrongSecret123`.

2. **Add the `DOWNLOAD_SECRET` Environment Variable on Render**

   Go to your Render dashboard:
   - Find your service and click on **Environment**.
   - Add `DOWNLOAD_SECRET` as a new environment variable with a strong value (e.g., `myStrongSecret123`).
   - Save the environment variable changes.

3. **Deploy and Test the Download Endpoint**

   Deploy your app on Render to apply these changes. Once deployed:
   - Open a web browser and go to the endpoint URL:
     ```
     https://your-app-url.com/download-sqlite-backup?secret=myStrongSecret123
     ```
   - This should start downloading `mineaid-backup.db` to your local system if everything is set up correctly.

4. **After Each Backup, Remove the Endpoint**

   For security purposes, **remove or comment out** the `/download-sqlite-backup` route after you’ve downloaded the backup. This will prevent unauthorized access to the database once you've completed the backup.

### Optional: Automate Backup with MEGAcmd (Alternative to Manual Download)

You can further automate this process by scheduling a script to access the `/download-sqlite-backup` endpoint and then upload the downloaded file to Mega.nz. This way, each time you redeploy, you can automatically back up the latest data from Render. Let me know if you'd like help setting this up!




-----------------------

Adding a download button on a page is a convenient option, especially if you want super admins or specific roles to initiate the download directly through the app’s interface. Here’s how to set it up for security and ease:

### Option 1: Add a Download Button on the Super Admin Page

If you only want super admins to access this button, place it exclusively on a page restricted to them (e.g., a super admin dashboard).

#### Steps to Add the Download Button

1. **Create a Button on the Super Admin Page**

   In your super admin page template (e.g., `superAdmin.ejs` or similar), add a button that will link to the download endpoint.

   ```html
   <!-- Only shows if user is a super admin -->
   <button id="download-backup-btn" onclick="downloadBackup()">Download Database Backup</button>
   ```

2. **Add JavaScript for Secure Download**

   Use JavaScript to add the secret parameter to the endpoint URL when the button is clicked.

   ```javascript
   <script>
     function downloadBackup() {
       const secret = '<%= process.env.DOWNLOAD_SECRET %>'; // Securely inject the secret from the environment variable
       window.location.href = `/download-sqlite-backup?secret=${secret}`;
     }
   </script>
   ```

   - This JavaScript function will redirect to the download endpoint with the secret, triggering the download.
   - Ensure the secret is only accessible on this page and for super admins by checking the user’s role in your route controller.

3. **Secure the Super Admin Page**

   Ensure your server code checks that only super admins can access this page:
   
   ```javascript
   app.get('/super-admin', (req, res) => {
     if (req.user && req.user.role === 'super-admin') {
       res.render('superAdmin', { user: req.user });
     } else {
       res.status(403).send('Access denied');
     }
   });
   ```

### Option 2: Restrict Access to Super Admin Only via Middleware

Alternatively, restrict access to the download endpoint itself with middleware that only allows super admins to access it. This ensures that even if the URL is known, only a super admin can trigger the download.

#### Middleware Example for Download Access

```javascript
function superAdminOnly(req, res, next) {
  if (req.user && req.user.role === 'super-admin') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied');
  }
}

// Use the middleware on the download endpoint
app.get('/download-sqlite-backup', superAdminOnly, (req, res) => {
  const dbPath = path.join(__dirname, 'database', 'mineaid.db');
  res.download(dbPath, 'mineaid-backup.db', (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error downloading database:', err);
      res.status(500).send('Error downloading the file');
    }
  });
});
```

This will ensure only users with the `super-admin` role can access the download directly, whether by a button or by entering the URL manually.

### Note on Security

After each backup download, consider commenting out or disabling this endpoint until it’s needed again. This way, your database remains secure between backup times.


-------------------

A dedicated database management page is a solid idea. Here’s a suggestion for what you could include:

### Suggested Content for the Database Management Page

1. **Database Backup & Restore Options:**
   - **Download Database Backup**: Button to download the current SQLite database backup.
   - **Upload Database Backup**: For restoring data, allowing an admin to upload a previous backup file.

2. **Data Export and Import:**
   - **Export as CSV**: Option to export key tables (such as users, incident reports, etc.) as CSV files.
   - **Import from CSV**: Ability to import CSV files back into the database, which could be helpful if migrating data or restoring specific records.

3. **Database Migration Tools (for PostgreSQL setup):**
   - **Migrate Data**: Initiate migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL if needed.
   - **Migration Logs**: Display logs or recent migration activities, like any errors or records processed.

4. **Database Health Check:**
   - **Database Status**: Show live status (active/inactive) and database size.
   - **Connection Test**: Test connectivity to verify that the application can access the database.

5. **Database Maintenance Options:**
   - **Clear Old Data**: Remove data older than a set period for tables like `recent_activities` to keep the database lean.
   - **Vacuum/Optimize Database**: Run SQLite's "vacuum" operation (or equivalent for PostgreSQL) to optimize performance.

6. **Scheduled Backup Configuration:**
   - **Set Scheduled Backups**: Toggle on/off or configure periodic backups to Mega.nz or other storage.
   - **Backup History**: View a list of previous backups (file name, date created) and download any from the list.

7. **Security and Logs:**
   - **View Database Access Logs**: For monitoring, show logs of recent superuser access to the database management page.
   - **Manage Access**: Add/remove permissions or update the superuser's access controls for this page.

### Route Setup (Example)

1. **Main Page Access (GET request)**
   - `GET /superuser/db-management` – Renders the database management page, accessible only by superusers.

2. **Database Actions (POST or GET requests)**
   - `POST /superuser/download-db` – Triggers the database download.
   - `POST /superuser/upload-db` – Processes a backup upload.
   - `POST /superuser/export-csv` – Exports selected tables as CSV.
   - `POST /superuser/import-csv` – Imports data from a CSV.
   - `POST /superuser/migrate-db` – Initiates migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
   - `POST /superuser/clear-old-data` – Clears data older than a specified date.
