Great! Let’s go through the steps to set up MEGAcmd and automate the backup process.

### Step 1: Install MEGAcmd
1. **Download MEGAcmd** from the official [Mega.nz MEGAcmd page](https://mega.nz/cmd).
2. Install it based on your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Run the installer after downloading.
   - **MacOS**: Use `brew install megacmd` if you have Homebrew installed.
   - **Linux**: Follow the Linux-specific installation instructions on the MEGAcmd page.

3. After installation, ensure the `mega-cmd` command is available by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:
   ```bash
   mega-cmd
   ```
   This should start the MEGAcmd server, allowing you to run Mega commands in another terminal window.

### Step 2: Log in to Mega.nz with MFA
1. **Open a New Command Prompt or Terminal** and log in with your credentials and MFA code:
   ```bash
   mega-login your-email@example.com your-password --auth-code="123456"
   ```
   Replace `123456` with the actual MFA code from your authenticator app.

2. **Verify** that you’re logged in by listing files on Mega.nz:
   ```bash
   mega-ls
   ```
   You should see the root directory structure of your Mega account if the login was successful.

### Step 3: Create a Backup Script with MEGAcmd Commands
Now, let’s create a script that will:
- Backup your SQLite database file to Mega.nz
- Use a timestamp to keep the backups organized

Create a file named `backup-to-mega.sh` (or `backup-to-mega.bat` on Windows) with the following content:

#### For Linux/MacOS (`backup-to-mega.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define paths
DB_PATH="./database/mineaid.db"
BACKUP_NAME="backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).db"

# Upload to Mega.nz
mega-put "$DB_PATH" "/Root/BackupFolder/$BACKUP_NAME"
```

#### For Windows (`backup-to-mega.bat`)
```batch
@echo off

:: Define paths
set "DB_PATH=.\database\mineaid.db"
set "BACKUP_NAME=backup-%date:~10,4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%%time:~0,2%%time:~3,2%%time:~6,2%.db"

:: Upload to Mega.nz
mega-put "%DB_PATH%" "/Root/BackupFolder/%BACKUP_NAME%"
```

In both scripts:
- Replace `/Root/BackupFolder` with your desired folder path on Mega.nz.
- `BACKUP_NAME` creates a timestamped filename like `backup-20241107123000.db`.

### Step 4: Schedule the Backup Script
You can automate this script to run periodically.

#### On Linux/MacOS
Use `cron`:
1. Open the cron editor:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
2. Add a line to schedule the backup, e.g., every day at midnight:
   ```bash
   0 0 * * * /path/to/backup-to-mega.sh
   ```

#### On Windows
Use **Task Scheduler**:
1. Open **Task Scheduler** and create a new task.
2. In **Actions**, add a new action to start `backup-to-mega.bat`.
3. Set a trigger (e.g., daily at a specified time).

### Step 5: Test the Backup
Run the script manually to ensure everything works:
```bash
# Linux/MacOS
bash backup-to-mega.sh

# Windows
backup-to-mega.bat
```

If you encounter any issues, let me know!

Certainly! Let’s consolidate the entire process into a clear, step-by-step guide, making sure that everything is in place and that you can successfully back up your SQLite database to MEGA using **MEGAcmd**.

### Step 1: **Install MEGAcmd**

1. Install **MEGAcmd** if you haven’t done so yet.
   - Download MEGAcmd from the [official website](https://mega.nz/cmd) or use the installer depending on your system (Windows/Mac/Linux).

2. Ensure MEGAcmd is installed and added to your system **PATH** so it can be run from any terminal window. 

   - On Windows, check if MEGAcmd is in the **`C:\Program Files\MEGAcmd\`** folder (or wherever you installed it). If it’s not recognized, you’ll need to add it to the system **PATH**.

3. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, type `mega-cmd`, and press **Enter** to start MEGAcmd.

### Step 2: **Log into MEGA**

1. In the **MEGAcmd terminal**, log into your Mega account using the following command:

   ```bash
   login mineaid.notifications@gmail.com }cx@,$mf56KSHfV --auth-code="626646"
   ```

   Replace `626646` with the actual MFA code that is sent to your email if prompted.

2. Once logged in, you should see the prompt change to something like:

   ```bash
   mineaid.notifications@gmail.com:/$
   ```

   This confirms that you're in your Mega account's root directory.

### Step 3: **Create a Backup Folder (if needed)**

1. In the **MEGAcmd terminal**, create a folder in your Mega account to store backups:

   ```bash
   mega-mkdir BackupFolder
   ```

2. You can confirm the folder was created by listing the contents of your Mega root directory:

   ```bash
   mega-ls
   ```

   You should see the `BackupFolder` in the list.

### Step 4: **Upload SQLite Database to Mega**

1. Assuming your SQLite file `mineaid.db` is located in the `./database/` folder of your project, you can upload it to your Mega backup folder using:

   ```bash
   mega-put ./database/mineaid.db /BackupFolder/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).db
   ```

   This command will upload your SQLite file and name the backup file with a timestamp (e.g., `backup-20241107094532.db`).

2. Verify the upload by listing the contents of the backup folder:

   ```bash
   mega-ls /BackupFolder
   ```

   You should see the `backup-<timestamp>.db` file.

### Step 5: **Automate Backups (Optional)**

1. To automate the backup process, you can create a **Windows batch file** (`backup-to-mega.bat`) or a **Linux/Mac shell script**.

   - **Windows**: Create a `backup-to-mega.bat` file:

     ```batch
     @echo off
     :: Define path to your local SQLite file
     set "DB_PATH=.\database\mineaid.db"

     :: Upload to Mega.nz with a timestamp
     mega-put "%DB_PATH%" "/BackupFolder/backup-%date:~10,4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%%time:~0,2%%time:~3,2%%time:~6,2%.db"
     ```

   - **Linux/Mac**: Create a `backup-to-mega.sh` file:

     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     DB_PATH="./database/mineaid.db"
     BACKUP_NAME="backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).db"
     mega-put "$DB_PATH" "/BackupFolder/$BACKUP_NAME"
     ```

2. **Schedule** the script to run periodically:
   - On **Windows**, you can use **Task Scheduler** to run the batch file.
   - On **Linux/Mac**, use **cron jobs** to schedule the backup script.

### Step 6: **Test Everything**

1. **Run the backup script** manually or via your scheduler to ensure the database is uploaded to Mega.

2. Verify the uploaded file in the Mega folder:

   ```bash
   mega-ls /BackupFolder
   ```

   You should see your `backup-<timestamp>.db` file listed there.

---

### Recap
- **Log in to Mega** using `mega-cmd` with your credentials.
- **Create a backup folder** in Mega.
- **Upload the SQLite database** using the `mega-put` command.
- **Automate the backup** using a script and schedule it to run periodically.

Now you have a reliable backup process that uploads your SQLite database to Mega and allows you to restore it when needed. Let me know if any part of the process needs further clarification!

It seems like two issues are happening here:

1. **PowerShell Date Syntax:**
   The error related to `$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)` suggests that PowerShell doesn't understand the `$(date ...)` syntax because it's designed for bash (used in macOS/Linux). In PowerShell, the correct way to get the current date and time in the desired format is different.

2. **`mega-put` Command Not Recognized:**
   The error `mega-put : The term 'mega-put' is not recognized` indicates that **MEGAcmd** might not be properly installed or available in your system’s PATH, which is why PowerShell doesn’t recognize the `mega-put` command.

### Solutions:

#### 1. **Fix Date Format for PowerShell:**
   To get the date in PowerShell, use this command instead:

   ```powershell
   $date = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss"
   ```

   Then, you can concatenate the `$date` variable into your `mega-put` command.

#### 2. **Ensure `mega-put` Is Available in PowerShell:**
   - First, confirm that **MEGAcmd** is installed properly and accessible from PowerShell.
   - If `mega-put` is not recognized, it suggests that the MEGAcmd CLI might not be in the system’s **PATH**.

### Step-by-step fix:

1. **Set the Date Format in PowerShell:**

   Run the following in PowerShell to get the current timestamp:
   ```powershell
   $date = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss"
   ```

2. **Formulate the Full Command Using the Date:**

   Replace the `$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)` part with `$date`:
   ```powershell
   mega-put C:/Users/Usman/Desktop/mineaid-webapp/database/mineaid.db /MineaidBackupFolder/mineaidbBackup-$date.db
   ```

3. **Check MEGAcmd Installation:**
   If `mega-put` is still not recognized, try the following:
   - Ensure that MEGAcmd is installed and available by running `mega-cmd` from PowerShell. If it's not recognized, you need to install it or add it to your system's PATH.
   - **Install MEGAcmd** (if needed):
     - [Install MEGAcmd from MEGA's website](https://mega.nz/cmd) or reinstall it.

4. **If MEGAcmd Is Working Properly:**
   If `mega-put` works in **MEGA CMD** but not PowerShell, you can also try running the command directly from the **MEGA CMD** terminal instead of PowerShell.

Let me know how it goes, and if you face further issues!
